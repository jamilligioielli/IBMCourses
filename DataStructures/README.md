# Data Structures & Algorithms, Level-up for Coding Interviews

## Instructor: Prateek Narang

----------

## Overview

The Course contains 25+ hours of interactive video content & dozens of coding exercises, teaching you the right tips & tricks in problem solving in a most concise way. Every problem discussion starts with a brute force approach, optimisations and ends with hands-on-coding video in C++ as well.

Here is what you will learn -

Problems on Data Structures

* Arrays, Strings, Vectors

* Hashing (Unordered Maps, Maps, Sets)

* Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists

* Binary Trees, BSTs, Heaps

* Graphs, Tries

Problems on Algorithms

* Brute force, Backtracking

* Sliding Window Algorithms

* Sorting, Searching, Binary Search

* Dynamic Programming Fundamentals

* Important Graph Algorithms

* BFS & DFS, Shortest Paths

Course exercises are in C++ but programmers having experience in one or more languages (C++/Java/Python/JavaScript) can definitely do this course, provided they have fundamental understanding of data structures. The course covers both breadth & depth of topics, diving deep where-ever needed. You will also learn how to apply techniques involving like - sorting & searching algorithms, sliding window, binary search, hashing which are very important for problem solving. For advanced topics like Dynamic Programming & Graphs, the course starts from the basics & helps you master these topics from the very fundamentals.
